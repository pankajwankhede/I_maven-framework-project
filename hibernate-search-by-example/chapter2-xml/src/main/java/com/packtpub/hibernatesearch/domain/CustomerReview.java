/**
 * An embeddable object (or "component" in traditional Hibernate jargon), resenting a customer review for a software 
 * app.  A review consists of the username for the person submitting the review, the number of "stars" (out of a 
 * possible 5) the app was rated, and any comments from the reviewer.
 * 
 * This variant of App is mapped to the database by core Hibernate using the classic XML-based approach.  
 * In the Maven project structure, all of the XML files are located under "src/main/resources".  Core Hibernate 
 * automatically examines "hibernate.cfg.xml", which in turn references "com/packtpub/hibernatesearch/domain/App.hbm.xml"
 * to load the mapping information the App entity (which contains CustomerReview object instances).  Because CustomerReview 
 * is not a full entity in its own right, it does not have an "hbm.xml" file of its own.  Core Hibernate configures it using
 * a "<composite-element>" XML element in the mapping file of any container entity (e.g. "App.hbm.xml").  
 * 
 * The lifecycle of these objects is dependant on that of their containing entity.  In other words, when an app is deleted, 
 * all of its customer reviews will be deleted also.
 * 
 * Because this embeddable class is NOT annotated with @Indexed, Hibernate Search will not create a Lucene index 
 * just for it.  Any information indexed for this class will be stored in the Lucene index of a containing entity (i.e. App).
