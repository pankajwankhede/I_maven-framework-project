This directory represents the state of the VAPORware Marketplace example application as 
of the end of the fourth chapter.  It expands upon the previous chapters to demonstrate 
built-in as well as custom type bridges, custom analyzers, boosting, and conditional 
indexing.

This codebase is structured as a Maven-based project (http://maven.apache.org).  If your 
IDE of choice offers Maven support, then you may import this project in the appropriate 
manner.  Otherwise, if you have Maven installed on your system, you may build and test 
the application from the command-line by changing to this directory and typing:

mvn clean jetty:run

The Maven "clean" goal removes working files from any previous builds.  The "jetty:run" goal 
builds the application and launches it with an embedded Jetty web server (http://www.eclipse.org/jetty) 
for testing.  You can access the running application by pointing your web browser to:

http://localhost:8080/
