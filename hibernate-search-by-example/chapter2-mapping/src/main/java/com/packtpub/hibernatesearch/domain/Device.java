/**
 * A simple entity class representing a hardware device... with a name, a manufacturer name, and a collection of 
 * software apps supported on the device.
 * 
 * This variant of Device is mapped to the database by core Hibernate using the classic XML-based approach.  
 * In the Maven project structure, all of the XML files are located under "src/main/resources".  Core Hibernate 
 * automatically examines "hibernate.cfg.xml", which in turn references "com/packtpub/hibernatesearch/domain/Device.hbm.xml"
 * to load the mapping information for this entity.  All of this produces the same end result as @Entity annotation 
 * used in the main version of this application.
 * 
 * Because this class is NOT annotated with @Indexed, Hibernate Search will not create a Lucene index just for it.  
 * Any information indexed for this class will be stored in the Lucene index of a containing entity (i.e. App).
